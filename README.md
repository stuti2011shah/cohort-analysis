# Online Retail Cohort Analysis

This project is focused on performing a cohort analysis on an online retail dataset. The analysis aims to provide insights into customer retention rates and purchasing behaviors over time. The project involves data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization using Python libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retailer, covering the period from December 2010 to December 2011. It includes the following fields:

- **InvoiceNo**: A unique identifier for each transaction.
- **StockCode**: A unique identifier for each product.
- **Description**: The name of the product.
- **Quantity**: The number of items purchased in each transaction.
- **InvoiceDate**: The date and time of the transaction.
- **UnitPrice**: The price per unit of the product.
- **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Country**: The country where the customer is located.

    ```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset file `Online Retail.xlsx`.
- **online_retail_cohort_analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook where the cohort analysis is performed.
- **README.md**: The file you're currently reading.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis includes several key steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Missing data and duplicates are handled, ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.
3. **Cohort Analysis**: Customers are grouped into cohorts based on their first purchase month, and their behaviors are tracked over time.
4. **Retention Calculation**: The retention rate for each cohort is calculated to understand customer loyalty.
5. **Visualization**: Retention rates and average quantities purchased are visualized using heatmaps.

## Results

The analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, including:

- **Customer Retention**: Understanding how well the business retains its customers over time.
- **Average Quantity Purchased**: Observing trends in the average quantity of items purchased by customers in each cohort.
